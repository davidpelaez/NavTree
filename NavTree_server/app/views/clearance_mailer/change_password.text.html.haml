%p Hello.

%p Our eccentric servers inform us that someone, hopefully you, has requested that we send you a link to change your password.


%p 
	Here's the link:   
	= edit_user_password_url(@user,:token  => @user.confirmation_token,:escape => false)

%p If you didn't request this, ignore this email. Don't worry. Your password hasn't been changed.
                     
%p Hope this was helpful and Thanks for growing your NavTree :)
