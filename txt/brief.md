*Initial Concept*
======
The important part in education, knowledge and entertainment that the web has today has open internet as a field of study on it's own. The technologies to be developed, the standards to be improved, the categorization and organization of the content available and the filtering of such content to make it relevant to personal interests are among the many studies, experiments and developments solely related to the web.

Given such concept I've become interested in the central question that gave origin to this project -how do we reach contents?- in other word how do we get in time from URLa to URLb. Inside that question various opportunities, hypothesis and technical and visual challenger emerge and this project is in essence and exploration through design of how to answer that question and, more importantly, how the information generated to answer that question can be an opportunity to generate relevant information that is enriching for the surfers and other stakeholders. 

*Idea*
======
The way a user browses online on his desktop (initially) can be recorded and represented as a set of trees (since some areas may not be connected at all, more than one tree appears) with different branches where each node is a url and the connections represent clicks to go from one node to the next. Such data set can then be understood as a directed(???) graph represented on a time line that is the starting point of this project, thus the codename Navigation Tree. We have then variables like time, location and precedence in the navigation tree for a given node. More variables like tags, ratings/likes, publication date and other semantic could be potentially added in the future. This additional variables are however way to complex to take into account in the original brief of this project.                                  

This project then focuses around the exploration of appropriate ways to gather the dataset and then the visualization of it in order to create information relevant at least for the user providing the data and the online community interested in understanding online user behavior.

*Hypothesis*
======
The afore mentioned visualization and information design is subject to various hypothesis that the project will try to incrementally validate in the following order:

- The NavTree can be visualized to provide the surfer source of the data with understanding of his consumption of online content through time in more complex and meaningful ways than existing linear browsing histories.

- The use of various NavTrees from different users allows us to create visualizations that represent different styles of web browsing in the form of patterns deriving from the basic variables considered in the dataset gathering.

- The inclusion of the previously mentioned more complex variables, specially semantic ones, could enable the complexity of the visualization to increase, making visible universes of content through which the users moves. The relation between those universes could be made visible or (even more interesting) the separation of them inside a hypothetical online endless semantic universe may appear.

- The ability to record from numerous surfers NavTrees can help gain insights on content consumption trends useful from a sociological perspective and for user research.

*Aims*
==========
The aims of the project can increment as one hypothesis has been validated. This project will complete by the end of the current semester and for the final jury presentations at least the validation of the first hypothesis.

*Project relevancy*  
===================
The project uses a simple basic concept, the NavTree, and mixes it with design tools for visualization, information design and programming with the intention of generating relevant information in different scopes. Initially the project improves the existing browser histories providing better understanding to the surfer regarding his online content consumption. On the other hand, the project has an exploratory nature that poses interesting potential to understand internet content from a sociological perspective as a phenomena of masses and from an economical and commercial perspective as a space of always on going trends. Last the project may be a humble empirical example of research for the sake of knowledge where the open end of the project and the incremental approach may bring more results and insights for the public interest than expected, specially given the intended openness of the process and results.

*Triggering Questions*
=====================
How do we get to certain content online?
How do we obtain new content?
How do we surf, what are the differences?               
Could we define a universe of content?
Can I know the universes of content where I move myself?
Is it possible to identify user niches according to their content consumption?


*Tasks (in order)*
==================
-Check references
-Define the structure of the dataset.
-Create dataset gathering tools                
-Define a minimum size of the required dataset.
-Gather data from at least 5 users if possible.
-Make decisions about the technologies to be used.
-Identify relevant factors for the information to be relevant for the user (aka Define key points)
-Initially sketch and validate the first visualizations
