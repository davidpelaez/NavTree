Soft Child Issue

It's very important to note that the completed extension has some particular constraints, some rules and in very very small cases can produce an inaccurate soft link. That soft link issue appears only when many many tabs are opened at the same time after the browser has been opened, for example opening a group of tabs from the bookmarks. The issue consists in some cases where the active tab open event is fired after other tabs are already loading in the background. As a result the extension fails to find the NavTreeTab in memory for the active tab and is uncapable of linking the tab in the background as a soft child of the active tab. That particular case should be rare, and fixing it may suppose a lot of complexity. It's still pending to decide weather to add or not such complexity to fix this unconsistency in the mapping.
